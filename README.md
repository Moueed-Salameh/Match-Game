# Overview #

A simple Match Game that can be deployed on a local Express.js server.
Users are presented with a list of related items and must select the items that correspond to one another. Correctly selecting two items will cause them to disapear from the page.
Currently, the game presents the user with various countries and their capitals.

# Future Improvements/Ideas #

- Add more data sets beyond just contries and capitals and allow the user to choose which data set to use
- Add a scoring system, e.g. how many matches the user got correct in a row or how fast they completed the matches
